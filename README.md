# 🇩🇿 Tech Competitions in Algeria

A public, open-source list of yearly tech competitions in Algeria — including hackathons, datathons, game jams, robotics tournaments, and more.

## 🎯 Purpose

Most Algerian students discover tech competitions through last-minute stories or word of mouth. This project aims to fix that — by collecting and maintaining a centralized, community-powered list of events across the country.
